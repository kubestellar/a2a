## Description
Implement an enhanced Model Context Protocol (MCP) with AI-to-AI (A2A) extensions for the KubeStellar Management Control Plane server, including distributed agent coordination, shared context management, and multi-provider AI integration.

## Expected Outcome
- Fully specified MCP with A2A extensions
- Python protocol handlers integrated with MCP server
- A2A message broker and routing utilities
- Shared context system with efficient serialization/deltas
- Pluggable AI provider abstraction and registry
- <100ms command-processing path for common operations
- Comprehensive tests and docs

## Tasks
### Phase 1: Foundation Enhancement
- [ ] Extend MCP protocol spec for A2A primitives (register, heartbeat, task, proposal, vote)
- [ ] Implement context serialization/delta mechanics
- [ ] Create A2A message broker (in-process) and interfaces
- [ ] Dev environment/tooling updates (linters, types, coverage)

### Phase 2: Core A2A Framework
- [ ] Inter-AI message routing (topic- and direct-based)
- [ ] Majority-vote consensus helper for distributed decisions
- [ ] Shared context manager wired to KubeStellar functions
- [ ] Task distribution algorithms (round-robin, by-capacity)

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Fault tolerance (queue backpressure, retries)
- [ ] Performance optimizations (<100ms happy path)
- [ ] Multi-provider AI integration via `llm_providers`
- [ ] Security/auth (HMAC tokens, basic RBAC)

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
- [ ] Integrate with MCP server and CLI, expose new tools
- [ ] KubeStellar upward/downward API alignment
- [ ] Benchmarks and optimization
- [ ] Security validation
- [ ] Documentation and examples

## Acceptance Criteria
- A2A-enabled MCP with protocol docs and code
- <100ms command latency on local paths
- 90%+ test coverage for new modules
- Works with multiple AI providers
- Integrated with KubeStellar flows
- Security with authentication/authorization

## Additional Notes
This issue introduces new modules under `src/a2a/` and function wiring under `src/shared/functions/`.
